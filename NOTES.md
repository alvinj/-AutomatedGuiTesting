# Notes

These are general notes I want to keep.


## Image recognition notes

The current image recognition code works, but it isn’t super-smart. For instance,
the small image must be the same size as the small image that’s inside the large
image. A much better image library may be able to find an image that looks like
the small image, but isn’t the same size.

Related to that, here are some links about using the OpenCV imaging library:

Of course there are other approaches, including AI/ML stuff, but this is just one imaging library I found.

This is a good link related to macOS, AppleScript, and keyboard keycodes:
